## Introduction

This is the front end for the Climate Changes web application. 

Through here, you can learn about how Climate Change is affecting our planet and find out more about the charities and organisations that work to curb its influence.

The Discover page holds a large amount of information including the current climate news, the daily weather warnings for Australia, and a weather forecast.

Any questions about this web application should be sent to the creator of the application - Ray Guo. 

## Getting Around

In the main folder "Frontendserver", you can find the primary Javascript files "routers.js" and "server.js". These are responsible for connecting the pages together and for connections to the back end. 

Under the folder "views", you will be able to find the files for the various pages. Look under the "css" or "js" folders for the files related to the various HTML5 files.

## Installation

After cloning the code to your system, run ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies as listed in the ```package.json```.

If you are needing the development scripts and ```npm install``` does not install them, try running ```npm install --dev```.

## Scripts

You can find all the general and development scripts inside the ```package.json```.
